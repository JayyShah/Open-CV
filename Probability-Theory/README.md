RANDOM VARIABLES

	-Random variables are used to define the possibilities of an event in terms of real numbers.
	The values it can represent are random and, by applying certain assumptions, we can restrict it to given range. To get started with random variables, we need to either compute a function
	that approximates its behavior or assume and prove our hypothesis function through experimentation.

In the discrete domain, random variables are discrete. Then the function used to model probabilities
is termed as Probability Mass Function(PMF).

	-Let x be a discrete random variable; it's PMF is:

	P(x=k) where k is one of the K different values of random variable x.

In the continuous domain, the function to model random variable's is termed as Probability Density Function
(PDF) which takes in continuous domain values of random variable x to produce probabilities p(x)



EXPECTATIONS

	-For a discrete random variable x, the expectation of a function f:
	Here p(x) is the probability mass function.

Check Expectation and continuous random variable image in the images folder for more clearity.

VARIANCE

	 -To measure the quality of concentration of random variable x 

	 Var[x] = E[(x - E(x))^2]

	 Above expression can also be converted into

	 Var[x] = E[x^2] - E[x]^2
